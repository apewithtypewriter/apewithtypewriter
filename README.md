Hi, Iâ€™m @apewithtypewriter.

I am currentlly learning Python and have my eyes on C++ or Rust in the future. I primarily want to use code to create images and sounds for artistic purposes.

I am interested in music, art, photography, and anything electronic. If I am not coding, I am playing my saxophone, hiking, taking photos, or playing around with MIDI instruments and breadboard circuits.
